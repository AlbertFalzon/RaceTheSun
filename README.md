# RaceTheSun
Small project created for an internship position

To play the game go on the build folder and select RaceTheSun.exe

This is also my first serious take on a 3d game in unity.
Since the plane is infinite the current plan is to have to obstacles move instead of the player.

The obstacles start spawning progressively faster at the 105, 85, 60 and 25 second timer marks where a variable used as a multiplier
for the default delay time between spawns is changed (starts at 1.5x at 120 and goes to 0.45x at 25)

Collision objects were made with cubes, but can be easily replaced with assets containing more complex designs and having a collider
component with "is trigger" enabled.

The scripts were revised/reworked multiple times to make it as efficient as possible. (all noted on github uploads)
